# simple-rx
This implementation is based on the source code of [zen-observable](https://github.com/zenparsing/zen-observable) and [toy-rx](https://github.com/staltz/toy-rx).
You can used it for learning. Maybe it is not fully tested for production env.

Aditional, some javascript files is not implemented, such as `event.js`, `promise.js`, also some methods in `util.js`.
Because I have no enough time to implement it.
